MongoDB Setup
    1. Create a MongoDB Database :
        Sign up or log in to MongoDB Atlas.
        Create a new project and then a new cluster.
        Choose a free tier if you're just testing.

    2. Configure Database Access :
        Go to the "Database Access" section.
        Create a new database user with read and write access.
        Note down the username and password.

    3. Whitelist Your IP Address :
        In the "Network Access" section, add your current IP address to allow connections.

    4. Get Your Connection String :
        In the "Clusters" section, click on "Connect" and then "Connect your application".
        Copy the connection string provided.

    5. Update Your Environment Variables :
        Create a .env file in the root of the Backend directory:
            MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
            PORT=3000
            JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
            ALERT_EMAIL = Email Id from which you want to send the list of absentees to the caretaker
            ALERT_PASSWORD = ALERT_EMAIL_PASSWORD

            Replace your_mongo_connection_string with the connection string you copied earlier, ensuring to replace <username> and <password> with your actual MongoDB username and password.
